# .fill-marker-baseline
# Format: <relative-file-path>=<allowed-[FILL:]-marker-count>
# Lines starting with # are ignored. Blank lines are ignored.
#
# HOW TO MAINTAIN:
# When merging a PR, CI checks the virtual merge commit (PR + current main).
# This means the counts here must reflect the POST-MERGE state, not just the
# PR branch state. If main advances between when a PR is branched and when it
# merges, any files that changed on main must be re-checked and their counts
# updated in this PR before merge.
#
# TO UPDATE AFTER ADDING/EDITING FILES:
#   1. Ensure you are on the PR branch with main merged in (or rebase on main).
#   2. Count with: grep -oh "\[FILL:" <file> | wc -l
#      IMPORTANT: use grep -oh (match count), NOT grep -c (line count).
#      grep -c counts lines; a line with two [FILL: occurrences counts as 1.
#      The check script uses `grep -o ... | wc -l` which counts individual matches,
#      so grep -c will give a wrong (lower) baseline and cause spurious CI failures.
#   3. Update the count here. Phase 1 of check-fill-markers.sh enforces that
#      the actual count never EXCEEDS the baseline (regressions fail; reductions
#      are fine — they just mean you resolved some placeholders).
#   4. New .md files with [FILL:] markers that are NOT listed here will be
#      caught by phase 2 (untracked file detection) and also fail CI.
#      Add them here immediately when creating them.
#
# Phase 2 of check-fill-markers.sh uses 'find', which descends into hidden
# directories (e.g. .agent/, .agents/, .claude/) by default — unlike rg.
# Any .md file in a hidden dir that contains [FILL:] markers WILL be flagged
# by Phase 2 if not listed here. Add new hidden-dir files below whenever
# a new SKILL.md, workflow, or rules file with [FILL:] markers is created.
