You are working on a project that uses AI coding agents across multiple tools.
Read and follow AGENTS.md at the repository root — it contains the authoritative
coding rules, file structure, and constraints for this project.

## Key Rules

- Follow all rules in `AGENTS.md` — they apply to every AI agent including Cursor.
- Follow coding standards in `.agent/rules/coding-standards.md`.
- Use commit format: `type(optional-scope): description`.
- Minimal changes — only touch files necessary for the task.
- No unsolicited features — don't add functionality the user didn't ask for.

## Documentation Hygiene

- Use `| --- | --- |` separator style for all Markdown tables.
- Every fenced code block must include a language specifier.
- Single H1 per file, logical heading increments.

## After Every Change

1. Run `[FILL: your test command, e.g. npm test]`.
2. Commit with format `type(scope): description`.
3. Ensure pre-commit hooks pass.

## Available Workflows

See `.agent/workflows/` for reusable procedures:
- `feature-delivery.md` — End-to-end feature workflow
- `hotfix.md` — Emergency hotfix procedure
- `doc-audit.md` — Documentation drift audit
- `pr-analysis.md` — PR quality review
- `release-readiness.md` — Pre-release quality gate
- `architecture-change.md` — ADR-gated architecture changes
