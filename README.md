## Why This Template Exists

Most developers configure their AI coding tools ad-hoc — a few lines in a `CLAUDE.md`, maybe a Copilot instruction file. The result: agents that hallucinate project conventions, make unsafe mutations, break existing patterns, and need constant correction.

This template encodes **production-ready agentic development practices** into a structured, multi-layered instruction system. It covers:

- **Consistent coding standards** enforced across all agents
- **Security-first rules** (XSS guards, escaping, forbidden APIs)
- **Safe AI orchestration patterns** (no hanging loops, MCP-first, strict timeouts)
- **Pre-built skills and workflows** for the most common engineering tasks
- **Documentation drift prevention** built in from the start
- **Git hook integration** for automated quality gates

Clone it, fill in your project details, and every AI tool working on your codebase will follow the same high-quality standards.

## Compatible AI Coding Agents

This template provides optimized configurations for all major AI coding tools:

| Agent | Config files | Key capability |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Claude Code** (Anthropic) | `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/`, `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/skills/` | Full skill system, path-scoped rules, subagents, hooks |
| **GitHub Copilot** (VS Code) | `.github/copilot-instructions.md`, `.github/prompts/`, `.github/instructions/` | Persistent instructions, prompt files, scoped instructions |
| **Cursor** | `AGENTS.md` | Project-wide context via rules file |
| **OpenAI Codex** | `AGENTS.md` | Project-wide context |
| **Kilo Code** | `AGENTS.md`, `.kilocode/rules/` | AGENTS.md context + dedicated project rules (priority 2) |
| **Google Jules** | `AGENTS.md` (read natively), `README.md` (env setup fallback) | Autonomous async task execution; Jules reads `AGENTS.md` automatically on every task |
| **Google Gemini / Antigravity** | `GEMINI.md`, `.agent/rules/`, `.agent/workflows/`, `.agent/skills/` | Always-on rules, reusable workflow definitions, skill library |

One template, every major agent, zero duplication.

## Quick Start

### Option A — Use as GitHub Template

Click **"Use this template"** at the top of this page to create a new repo from it.

### Option B — Clone and Copy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/agentic-coding-template.git
cp -r agentic-coding-template/. your-project/
rm -rf your-project/.git
```

### Configure (5 minutes)

**Step 1 — Find all placeholders.** Every customization point is marked with `[FILL: ...]`:

```bash
grep -rn "\[FILL:" . --include="*.md" | grep -v README
```

**Step 2 — Fill in the most important files:**

| File | What to provide |
| --- | --- |
| `CLAUDE.md` | Project name, key constraints, prohibited patterns, test command |
| `AGENTS.md` | Project name, architecture overview, file structure |
| `.github/copilot-instructions.md` | Always-do / never-do rules, key file table |
| `.claude/agents/qa-reviewer.md` | Project-specific review checklist items |
| `.agent/rules/coding-standards.md` | Architecture constraints, stack-specific rules |

**Step 3 — Remove what you don't need.** Sections like "Immutable Contract" or "Layout Constraints" are designed to be deleted for projects that don't need them.

**Step 4 — Activate Git hooks** (optional but recommended):

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit .githooks/commit-msg
```

**Step 5 — Set up secrets** (required for Jules AI scripts):

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit .env and add your JULES_API_KEY
```

The `.env.example` documents every variable the scripts expect. `.env` is git-ignored — never commit real keys.

Done. Your AI agents now operate with full project context.

## Pre-built Skills

Every skill is ready to invoke. Universal skills need no customization; project-specific ones have `[FILL:]` markers.

| Skill | Invoke | What it does |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Brainstorming** | `/brainstorming` | Structured ideation — explores user intent and constraints before building |
| **Systematic Debugging** | `/systematic-debugging` | Root-cause analysis — never guess, always trace |
| **QA Audit** | `/qa-audit` | 9-phase security + robustness audit: XSS, rule compliance, race conditions |
| **Doc Audit** | `/doc-audit` | Documentation drift detection across all instruction files and project docs |
| **Feature Delivery** | `/feature-delivery` | End-to-end feature workflow: planning → implementation → QA → docs sync |
| **Release Readiness** | `/release-readiness` | Pre-release quality gate with automated + manual checks |
| **Hotfix** | `/hotfix` | Emergency fix workflow with risk assessment |
| **Requesting Code Review** | `/requesting-code-review` | Structured review request with context |
| **Writing Plans** | `/writing-plans` | Spec-to-plan conversion before any code is written |
| **Frontend Design** | `/frontend-design` | Production-grade UI components — avoids generic AI aesthetics |
| **Architecture Change** | `/architecture-change` | Controlled architecture refactor with ADR requirement |
| **Skill Creator** | `/skill-creator` | Create new custom skills for your project |
| **Find Skills** | `/find-skills` | Discover all available skills |
| **Using Superpowers** | `/using-superpowers` | Skill discovery on session start |

---

## Pre-built Workflows

Workflows are detailed, multi-phase procedures that agents follow step by step. Unlike skills (invoked interactively), workflows are loaded by agents working through a structured task.

| Workflow | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `doc-audit.md` | Comprehensive docs drift audit across all layers |
| `qa-audit.md` | Full-scope quality audit with 9 structured phases |
| `feature-delivery.md` | Feature planning → implementation → QA → docs sync |
| `release-readiness.md` | Pre-release quality gate |
| `architecture-change.md` | ADR-gated architecture refactors |
| `hotfix.md` | Emergency fix with risk assessment |
| `pr-analysis.md` | Pull request quality review |
| `post-merge-analysis.md` | Post-merge verification |

---

## Universal Rules Baked In

These rules are active for all agents on day one — no setup required.

**AI Orchestration Safety**

- No hanging bash loops — agents iterate with individual tool calls
- MCP Server Tools over raw CLI calls (GitHub, databases, APIs)
- Every subprocess call has a strict timeout (`{ timeout: 10000 }`)
- No `eval()`, `document.write()`, or stateful browser APIs

**Code Quality**

- Config files get a structured header comment explaining their schema
- Code comments in English, always
- UTF-8 without BOM on all files

**Documentation Hygiene**

- Markdown tables: aligned `| --- | --- |` separator style
- Every fenced code block includes a language specifier
- Single H1 per file, logical heading hierarchy, unique subheadings
- No duplicate subheadings within a document

**Git Discipline**

- Repo-local hooks via `.githooks/`
- Commit format enforced: `type(optional-scope): description`
- Pre-commit quality gates before every commit

---

## The `[FILL:]` System

All project-specific content uses a consistent placeholder convention:

```text
[FILL: project name]
[FILL: describe your tech stack constraints here]
[FILL: e.g. "npm test" or "pytest" or "cargo test"]
```

This makes it trivially easy to scan for unfinished configuration:

```bash
grep -rn "\[FILL:" . --include="*.md"
```

Inline setup annotations use a different marker so they're visually distinct:

```html
<!-- SETUP: Replace this section with your project's file structure -->
```

---

## Design Principles

**1. Multi-layered** — Each AI tool gets its own config file in its native format. Claude reads `CLAUDE.md` and `.claude/`; Copilot reads `.github/copilot-instructions.md`; Jules reads `AGENTS.md` natively; Antigravity reads `.agent/`. One source of truth, delivered in every dialect.

**2. Universal + project-specific** — Universal rules (security, orchestration, markdown quality) ship ready-to-use. Project-specific rules are clearly marked with `[FILL: ...]` and isolated from the universal content.

**3. Prevention over correction** — Rules are designed to stop agents from making dangerous changes — not to catch mistakes after the fact. Security guards and forbidden patterns are enforced upfront.

**4. Drift-free** — Documentation drift is a leading cause of agent misbehavior. The doc-audit skill and workflow track every file that must stay in sync and surface drift proactively.

**5. Skill-based** — Complex multi-step tasks (audits, feature delivery, debugging) are codified as invocable skills. Skills are reusable, composable, and version-controlled alongside your code.
